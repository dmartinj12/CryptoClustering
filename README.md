# CryptoClustering

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior. The primary goals are to:

Normalize and Analyze Data: Prepare cryptocurrency market data by normalizing features and visualizing data distributions.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies Using K-means: Identify natural groupings of cryptocurrencies by testing and determining the optimal number of clusters, or "k," with the elbow method.

Optimize Clusters Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce data dimensionality while retaining essential information, then re-cluster the reduced data to evaluate the impact of fewer features on clustering results.

Through these steps, the project aims to reveal patterns within the crypto market and assess the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.
